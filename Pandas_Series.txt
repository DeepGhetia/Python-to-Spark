1. Always remeber list is the key here in pandas
2. sum(case when col = True then 1 else 0) / sum(col1) (SQL) -> appropriate func without groupby in pandas
Some rules in Seres and Df
    1. series can be created with scalar/list/dic with or without other parameter but for a single None value we have to pass list
        if dic - key(index) and values(data)
    2. DF can be created with list/dict/tup etc and scalar can be also passed but index and col both should be added.
        ALso index and col both have to passed with iterator we cant pass single scalar value
    3. adding values to col in df when newly created we can add scalar,lt,series as index is already present in existing df.
        But note here when series is passed the index is imp as the data is mapped with existing df index if no match then nan.
    4. But one catch while pasing None value in s it should not be a scalar value.
    5. Any operation along with Null will always return Null value.
Always Note (FOR DATETIME hack):- 
    1. while working with datetime while reading check properly if string or datetime generally it is string always we need to explicitly cast
    2. for filtering we can use string as no other option also implicit converstios happen
    3. using other func such as .dt.day we get integer
    4. always check the formatting

1. Series - 
* series can have multiple mixed dtype(data types) just like a list.
* by default - int64, float64, (mixed-types) - object, all string (object(slower) or string(faster)), dict,list(object)
* series vs df - series no col name but df does.
* syntax = pd.Series(data, index, dtype, copy, name)
    data - lt, dic, etc
    index - default - [0,1...] [optional]
    dtype - optional
    copy - optional [two options - True or Fasle]
    name - placeholder if only playing with series but when you convert s to df then name will act as col name in df created.
* converting s to df is easy using pd.concat (horizontal or vertical stacking) or pd.merge
        syntax - 
        s = pd.Series(dic, index=[1, 2], name='deep')
        s1 = pd.Series(dic1, index=[1, 2], name='ghetia')
        df = pd.concat([s,s1],axis=1)
* s.reset_index(drop=true) // this resets the index from anything to 0,1,2,3...(posiitonal unique)
  but by default drop=False(This moves the labelled index to column under index column name)
* similarly there is this parameter ignore_index = True // strictly note this is not a function just a paratmeter used in pd.concat etc.
  this works only with some funcs such as pd.cocnat also note it resets index only when axis=0 and resets col when axis=1
* we can shuffle the series using reindex method - s = s.reindex([pass the index's]) //we can also pass columns=list of cols Note:- this is very imp as we can add extra cols look at lc prob:- 1179
* we can also set a col to index using df.set_index(colname, inplace=True/Fasle)
* we can also use df.sort_index() to sort the rows based on index of the df/s
* now to convert df to s - 
        syntax - 
        1. s = df.squeeze() #single col in df
        2. s = df['name'].squeeze() #multiple cols
        3. s = df.iloc[2].squeeze() #converting individaul rows to series
* also type conversion of a series - 
    s = s.astype('float64') for a single df col df[] = df[].astype() for multiple col's df = df.astype(dic) for applying it to all col in df df = df.astype('int')
* two imp methods in pandas are
    1. series to df conversion s.to_frame()
    2. serues to list conversion s.tolist() for df it is //single-col -> df[].values.tolist() //mul-col -> df.values.tolist()
* for series it is s.dtype(series) not s.dtypes(df's)
* attributes and imp method's - 
    # df.info() (proc contents)/df.describe() (proc means) //works for both series and df
    # s.dtype -> type
    # s.values -> values in nupmy array form of list not normal list to convert to normal list [i.item() for i in i.values]
    This above conversion can directly done from s.values to list if dtype is string or object not int64 or float64.
    //just a tip never use s.values it is just for info always go for s.tolist()
    # s.name -> name or placeholder // df.columns in df
    # size and count have major diff count(not null values only) and size (all values)
    # s.index -> list of but of type pandas can be converted easily to list
    # s.size -> len for series and row*col count for df's
    # s.shape -> (row,col) but in this case (always row,)
    # s.empty -> true if empty
    # s.isnull()/notnull() -> this is a method gives true if blank else flase but row index wise
    # s.unique() -> it gives numpy array of unique values and follow same process same as s.values
    # s.nunique() -> (same as count()) give the count of unique values **count in series but in df it is dicto same as count() just has dropna extra
    # s.isnull().any()/all() -> single True / False value
    # s.head()/s.tail() -> by default 5
    # s.round(2) / df.round(2) roud method.
    # s.loc[] / s.iloc[]
    consider this below example to better learn - 
        lt = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
        s = pd.Series(lt, index=[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], name='deep')
        print(s.iloc[9]) #this gives index(not man made) based retrieval also here you can get only one value as index is unique
        print(s.loc[9]) # this gives index(man made) based retrieval but here you can have duplicates
    # s.hasnans -> return true if any nan value else False not a record level - only series method
* use of s.str and s.dt attribute but along with str and dt methods - 
    STR.
        Note:- str can only be used when data is object and string only and similar for datetime64[ns] as dt
            # we can use the str.func() syntax - 
            1. s.split(), s.str.lower(), upper(), strip(), lstrip(), rstrip(), title(), capitalize(), replace() - almost all the string func works
            2. we can use s.len() to get the len
            3. for substring/slixcing we can use str.slice(strart, end, step)
            4. str.contains(data, case=True/False, na(np.nan)=True/False, regex=True/False) - pattern matching imp concept.
        Note in str attribute is all the functions are same as python just few differences. // '|' we can pass this for more than one data
        Also for reversingor choosing a string from list etc:- we can directly use .str[::-1] or .str[0]
    DT.
        Note in: Dt we have multiple attributes -
        1. .dt.day, month, year, hour, minute, second, microsecond, nanosecond (all date attributes), .dt.days
        2. .dt.date, .dt.dayofweek, .dt.isocalendar().week .dt.quarter (all date attributes)
        3. .dt.time, .dt.total_seconds() (all time attributes)
        4. to get the week no in a month we use .dt.isocalendar().week
        Note in: Dt we have multiple methods -
        1. .dt.strftime() to string
        2. p.to_datetime(s, format='') to datetime
        3. noraml strftime %u gives 1-7 but dayofweek in series gives 0-6
        
* null's in pandas is consistent acrss dof and series - 
    # majorly sirf 4 type ke null hai in pandas - 
    # np.nan -> works for float64, object toh agar mere code mein [1, np.nan, 2] toh type float64 ho jayega
    # pd.NA -> works for Int64 not int64, string, object boolean not bool(normal pandas)
    # None -> works for object /string but when [1,none,2] then output is float64
    # pd.NaT -> only datetime, timedelta

    Value	isnull()	Default dtype	Notes
    np.nan	✅ True	float64, object	Default for numeric nulls
    None	✅ True	float64 or object	Casts to np.nan or object
    pd.NA	✅ True	depends on dtype	Requires nullable type (Int64, etc.)
    pd.NaT	✅ True	datetime64[ns]	Specific to time types

    | Data Type | Recommended `dtype` |
    | --------- | ------------------- |
    | Integer   | `"Int64"`           |
    | String    | `"string"`          |
    | Boolean   | `"boolean"`         |
    | Datetime  | `"datetime64[ns]"`  |

* filtering (series) and (DataFrame) - Brackets is the most imp things
    # in filtering the main thing to note is this line condtion = udf and final_s = s[condition]
    # we can use multiple condition using &(and), |(or), ~(not) oper - do check series.python
    # also brakcets are very imp when it comes don to filtering.
    # two main scenarios - 
        1. creating a new df - df[((df['A']>2) & (df['C']>10))][['C','D']]
        2. just getting a saclar value - val = ((df['A']>2) & (df['C']>10)).sum() note here before sum() we will get  aseres of true/false values

*PD.CONCAT([frame1,fram2], axis=0/1, join='outer/inner'(by default outer), sort=True/False(default = False), ignore_index=True/False(default = False)) - 
pd.concat([]) - performs union-all when axis=0 which is by default oper and for union use drop_duplicates()
and when axis=1 then it does horizontal appending but based on labelled index remeber that this is imp 
also there should not be any duplicates in any of the labelled index.

// pd.cocnat cheatsheet - (when axis is 0 no role of index whats so ever siimilarly when axis is 1 no role of col)
1. Seires - 
    axis = 0 and index same or different - 
    join inner - union all, index as is
    join outer - unoin all, index as is

    axis = 1 (index logic gets activated) and index same - 
    join inner - append horizontally but match the index comon index values are matched
    join outer - append horizontally since index is same so no issue

    axis = 1 and index not same - 
    join inner - blank df if no index matches as index is imp
    join outer - append horizontally since index is not same so NA values added

2. DataFrame - 
    axis = 0 and index is same or not same:
    join inner - union all but only where cols are present in both df's and empty df if no col is present in both df's
    join outer - union all with all the col from all df's and NA values where-ever needed

    axis = 1 and index is same:
    join inner - since axis is one hence index is mapped and add the col horizontally only for common index
    join outer - since axis is one hence index is mapped and add all col horizontally

    axis = 1 and index is not same:
    join inner - since axis is 1 hence map based on index if no index is matching then return empty df or return appropriate index only which matched.
    join outer - since axis is 1 hence map based on index if no index is matching retun all as outer

| Join Type            | Function to Use            | Works on                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Index-based join** | `pd.concat()` or `.join()` | Index (row labels)            |
| **Key-based join**   | `pd.merge()`               | Column values (like SQL `ON`) |

* two imp methods are all() and any() in pandas also.
* df.drop([0,1], axis=0, inplace=True/False) or df.drop(['a','b'], axis=1, inplace=True/False) //axis has to be 2nd in position basis

* Methods to deal with Null Values - 
    Detect Null values - All 4 methods return row by row true / false
        s.isnull() / s.isna()
        s.notnull() / s.notna()
    Drop the rows / columns - 
        df.dropna(axis=0/1, how='any/all', inplace=True/False, subset=[col1,col2]) //axis=0 for row ad axis=1 for col
        ***also remeber when every you use subset inside dropna it will drop only rows where we look only for specified col's
        *** series mein axis=1 nahi hota hain
        So if you want to drop a specific col only then go for this type of code - 
            //for i in df.columns:
                //if df[i].isna().any() == True:
                    //df.drop(i, axis=1, inplace=True)
    Fill values in place of blank - 
        df.fillna(value, method=None/pad/ffill/bfill, inplace=True/False)
            // value can be anything except list can be (single val, dict, ser, df's)
        df.iterpolate(method='linear',inplace=True)
        //this is basically guessing the data between a start and end point remeber it.
        // works only for integers gives warning for string types

* Methods to deal with duplicate values (subst passed is taken together i.e. all the cls in subset taken together) - 
    *to check the duplicate values in 
        series = s.duplicated(keep='first/last/' or false) #keep = first means mark first rec as non dup and rest as dup's similary last and false means mark all as dup's
        df's = df.duplicated(keep, subset=[col,col]) #subset is the col to include without which complete record will be considerered as criteria
        Note:- when we use .sum() along with duplicated() with interchanging keep values (first/last) there will not be any change in sum output.
    
    *to drop duplicates in
        series  = s.drop_duplicates(keep,inplace=True)
        df = df.drop_duplicates(keep,subset,inplace) #if no subset is provided then complete recod is checked to remove dup values
    *to get the count of dup's then go for value_counts / count
    *series has a unique() method that works only with series and returns list of unique values
    *nunique() works for both s/df's1 and is same as count but for unique entries only
        s - gives unique count
        df - gives column wise count works same as count() but by deafult omits null values same as value_counts()
        ***nunique has dropna=True/False option

* remember we can use different python fnc such as sum/max/min along with other df methods - 
    Ex:- df.isnull().sum(), df.isna().any()
* df/s.count() (count not null values only)
        1. for series it is basically count not null values directly 
        2. for df it is 
                there are 2 thimgs axis = 0/1
                by default axis=0 i.e column wise count when axis = 1 i.e row-wise count
* df/s.value_counts() (count all not null values also null but we have to use dropna=False) there is no axis concept in value_counts
        1. for series value counts will give value and count for not null values by default
        2. for df it is
                by default we get rows wise count like for example - 
                    A  B  
                    4  3.0    1
                    4  4.0    1
                to get for individaul col or multiple col then we can use df[col].value_counts(dropna=False)

* GROUP BY & HAVING-
    Syntax - df.groupby(columns that you want to group with, dropna=False/True).agg(
        #here is the cathy part - below ar the 4 different types included
        output_col_name_w/o_quotes = (col_name_present_in_df, agg_func(count/min/max/sum/mean)), -> sql - sum(col1)
        output_col_name_w/o_quotes = (col_name_present_in_df, lamdba x: x.apply(lamdba y: appropriate filteration).sum()/min()/max()/mean()/count()) -> sql - sum(case when amoutn > 200 then 1 else 0 end),
        output_col_name_w/o_quotes = (col_name_present_in_df, lamdba x: x[df.loc[x.index, 'col_that will be used for filteration].notna() & df.loc[x.index,'email'].str.contains('.com)].mean()) -> sql - avg(case when email like '%.com' then amount else 0 end),
        output_col_name_w/o_quotes = (col_name_present_in_df -> note here this col is irrelevant as this doesnt make sense check sql code for it, lamdba x: (df.loc[x.index,'col1']>df.loc[x.index,'col2']).sum()) -> sql - sum(case when col1 > col2 then 1 else 0 end)
    ).reset_index(drop=True/Fasle)

    *****Big Note when using count wihth null values in pandas alsways go for sum() insted of count() as it count FAlse also.
    rest of the having-clause filteration can be done using boolan filteration method.

* SORTING - 
    df.sort_values([col1,col2], ascending=True/False or [True,Fasle], inplace=True/False, ignore_index=True/False)
    df.sort_index(inplace=True, ignore_index)

#.TRANSFORM method - 
    Note:-
    #order by has one or more col's
    func() over()  -> df['sum'] = df['salary'].nunique() #any func can be applied
    func() over(partition by col) -> df['sum'] = df.groupby('department')['salary'].transform('count')  #any func can be applied
    func() over(order by col) -> df = df.sort_values('salary',ascending=False), df['sum'] = df['salary'].cumsum() #only cumsum(),cumin().cummax() can be applied
    func() over(partition by col order by col) -> df = df.sort_values('salary',ascending=False), df['sum'] = df.groupby('department')['salary'].cumcount() + 1 #count and sum both works

    to summarize() pandas can handle all the window func except count() over(order by col)
            
* RANKING - #ranking func() try to sort first good practise
    #order by has one col
    rank(),dense(),rank() over(order by col) -> df['rank'] = df['salary'].rank(method='first') first/min/dense all work
    rank(),dense(),rank() over(partiton by col order by col) -> df['rank'] = df.groupby('department')['salary'].rank(method='first') first/min/dense all work

    #order by has more than one col
    except row_number() and can be only using cumcount()
    pandas doesn't handle more than on col in order by correctly as sql but still you can give a try by creating a tuple for the order by col's

#lead/#lag
df['col'] = df['col'].shift(1/-1) -> -1 = lead and 1 = lag
df['col'] = df.groupby('col')['col'].shift(-1/1)

#PIVOT AND PIVOT_TABLE
    1. Pivot - Reshape the data but without groupby (on unique data only col/col+index)
        df.pivot(index=, columns= , values= ) #only col is mandatory if no index then 0,1.. and all the remaining col will be taken as values
        # if only col is given then it should be unique
        # if index+col is give both togehtr should be unique
        # not fill_value parameter in this
        # reset_index() is also usefull unlike in groupby

    2. PIVOT_TABLE - 
        df.pivot_table in this we have mainly 5 parameter
            index, values, columns, fill_value, aggfunc
            by default pivot table will need atleast cloumns or index to be passed for grouping
            and also if my complete df excpet the columns passed in index/columns param are number then "mean" will be calculated.
            1. by default index/columns needed and aggfunc = mean(auto applied if not passed)
            2. If you want both group-by columns as row hierarchy → put both in index.
               If you want one to spread horizontally like pivoted columns → put one in index, one in columns.
            3. when passing multiple col's use list in index/columns/values but for aggfunc use dic {colanme:func}
            # reset_index() is also usefull unlike in groupby
    
    3. MELT METHOD - USED TO UNPIVOT THE PIVOTTED DATA FROM PIVOT/PIVOT_TABLE
        Things to note:
        It does similar job as union/unionall n sql for unpivotting rememberthat
        pd.melt(df, id_vars='', value_vars='', var_name='', value_name='')
            id_vars -> it is the main col
            value_vars -> It is the col that needs to be unpivotted #not mandatory
            var_name -> u=once unpivot is completed it is the name of that col
            value_name -> it is the col name of unpivotted data col
            #when unpivotting valuevars has to be passed with list of col name

Points to Note:-
1. In DF row = Index, Col is tho Col only remeber that.
2. ALways note that when ever you have null values alsways note to use isna() or is null() or notna() or not null()
3. when you use joins the joining id is will always comes once but not joining duplicate it will come as _x, _y
//joining multiple tables is possible but using chaining - 
    df = df1.merge(df2, on="id", how="inner") \
            .merge(df3, on="id", how="left") \
            .merge(df4, on="id", how="right")
4. when doing pandas always remember not just you have to use pandas but also python ex:- if one col analysis then work on python and then convert to appropriate series and df.
5. always remeber when grouping the agg col is always imp more than grouping col.
6. do not forget tolist and toframe also for df->list means alwasy mentioning col name.
7.     if len(lt)>0:
        val = pd.Series(max(lt), name='num').to_frame()
    else:
        val = pd.DataFrame({'num':[None]})
8. remeber you can create a col using union and add appropriate data in sql wthout using any col from any table - 
        Ex:- select 'Low Salary' as category union select 'Average Salary' union select 'High Salary'
9. for adding a new columns to df we can give lt/scalar/series
10. always note use pd.merge in case of find something from one table not present in table 2
11. creating a new col in same df and applying some func applies to a nes col and while creating a new var but applying the same func and using boolean filtering will filter out the data
12. list is an imp ds in pandas everything revolves around list.
