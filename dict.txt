tuple (immutable) -
cannot do anthing with tuple after creation just can del the complete tuple
indexing/accessing is possible

dict - 
1. always note list(i) where i is dict gives only key values in list similar to waht list(i.keys()) does.
2. always remeber when use use dic without dic.values() or items() it is always keys in any given things***
2. # Valid keys
    d = {
        "name": "Alice",
        42: "Answer",
        (1, 2): "Tuple Key",
        True: "Boolean Key",
        frozenset([1, 2, 3]): "Frozen Set Key"
    } #invalid types: list, set, dict
    #key should be immutable and values can be im/m
3. copy - dic1 = dict(dic)
4. concat dict = "|"
5. del dic['a'] -> to delete key and value
6. always try to keep in mind to use the list or tuples when multiple dic's are present. - refer dict.py
7. jab tum pura ek sath dic dekh sakte hon then y go for for loop.
8. always keep mind and eyes wide open dont over complex the logic.
9. list(dict) is the new normal.
10. always remeber when iterating key and values together to check ame elements always go for for -> for loop (double for loop).
11. remeber this line when you are adding the var of some dic to same var then try this kind of logic. 
val = dic['Carla ']
print(val)
for i in range(1,len(lt)):
    val = val[lt[i]]
12. always note 
    say i have t = ('deep',1)
    print(dict(t))
    here this is not going to work as len of tuple is 2 always note for something to be cnverted to dict the len should always be 1 with 2 elements.
    ideally like this t = [('deep',1)]
13. one of the very good questions - https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/list/python-data-type-list-exercise-94.php
this example shows tuple and dic bahi bhai.
14. the OG method - whenever you have value but want key - 
        dic = {1:'deep',2:'ghetia',4:'is',3:'good'}
        val = ['ghetia','deep','good']

        final = []
        for i in val:
            // this is the line - temp = [a for a,b in dic.items() if i==b]
            final.append(temp[0])
        print(final)
    
15. in dic comprehension while using if else statements we cannot declare key:val in else block we will have to gvie only value
