when we talk about accessing in pandas - 

    //here you have choie row/col or both
    1. df.loc[row,col] - in rows slicing is allowed and in columns also but we can pass the list in columns also (slicing allowed all inclusive) 
    syntax:- df.loc[start:stop:step]
    2. df.iloc[row,col] - i(integer) - we can only use integer in both rows and columns (slicing allowed)

    //here you dont have choice
    3. df.at[row,col] - salar value access means we can pass only 1 index and 1 col at a time
    4. df.iat[row,col] - similar to at but integer

Boolean filteration is easy - 
mask = df['col']=='good' ('&','|','~')
df = df[mask]
print(df)

Always Note there is diff between tese two - 
val = df['Age'].mean()
df['mean'] = df['Age'].mean()
# two main scenarios - 
        1. creating a new df - df[((df['A']>2) & (df['C']>10))][['C','D']]
        2. just getting a saclar value - val = ((df['A']>2) & (df['C']>10)).sum() note here before sum() we will get  aseres of true/false values

we have special func - 
    1. .isin([]) acts as a in in sql pass list in isin func
    2. .between(start,stop) as a between in sql inclusive ex:- col between 100 and 200
    3 .replace(something, something else) #more than one ele then use dic

most imp - 
////now there is a scenario - 
that my df has a single col
hence Always go for one of these - 
    df['string'].tolist()
    df['string'].values.tolist()

//
isin = in also we have ~ = not in
contains = like
multiple contains (|) = like or //we can also use any()/all()
.between and .replace()

#
1. rearranging cols
2. df.rename(columns={}, inplace=True/Fasle)
3. selecting df[[col1 ,col2]]
4. chaining means multiple func applied in a single line
5.
